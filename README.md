# myTask
myTask is my Computer Science NEA coursework.
It is a modile application built in Xamarin.Forms and TinyIoC Container to automatically manage user's timetable. The user just adds new tasks specifying some parameters such as duration, deadline and priority and the app automatically allocates the time slot for the task to be completed in.

The project is currently archived, but there is no reason I would not resume it and make it more fancy.

# Plan
- [ ] Rewrite the whole app in Flutter
- [ ] Pull a backend API for sync
- [ ] Implement Machine Learning

# Contribution
Just create a pull request. I did not leave many comments, so you would surpise me if you even understand something.
